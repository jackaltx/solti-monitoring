# SOLTI - Systems Oriented Laboratory Testing & Integration

## Overview

SOLTI provides a comprehensive framework for testing and integrating system components in a controlled environment. The project emphasizes methodical testing, system behavior analysis, and component integration.

## Claude Instructions

This is the goal.
I want to start on solti-enemble
I need a recipe that I can repeat in script to build the ansible collection similar to monitoring collection.  (note: this now solti-monitoring in future.)
Create the  solti-ensemble/verify_output with a .gitignore everything.

The long term goal is the pattern of what makes a solti 'collection' and how far we can go with molecule testing will work. (first we test, then we consolidate)

## Name Origin

- **S**ystems: Managing and testing system-of-systems
- **O**riented: Structured and purposeful approach
- **L**aboratory: Controlled testing environment
- **T**esting: Verification and validation
- **I**ntegration: Component interconnection and interaction

Named after Sir Georg Solti, renowned for his precise and analytical conducting style.

## Project Structure
